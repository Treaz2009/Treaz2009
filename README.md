About me: 
Hello ðŸ‘‹

About me: 

My name is Andrey Samoilov. 



Until recent times, my professional career was mainly concerned with restaurant business. After graduation I worked as a cook and eventually was promoted to the position of a chef. The scope of my responsibilities involved developing and introducing new and seasonal menus, managing and restructuring the work the restaurants and launching new cooking technologies. Moreover, I have had the experience of being a home chef while serving in a couple of families.

During the quarantine 2020, I decided that acquiring new qualifications were something I should be focusing on. Hence, I successfully went through the course of SEO at Geekbrain.ru and later on had some hands-on practice in working as a SEO where I checked duplicate web pages and optimized search enginesâ€™ inquiries. Soon after I realized that pure marketing was not something that interested me much.

So, in June 2022 I took a course into manual QA testing at sedtest-school.ru having had work practice on the project at wildberries.ru. I am also studying Python, test automatization in Selenium IDE, and working with SQL at stepik.org.
